        <h2>Project Info</h2>
        <p>As the world population continues to grow, new agricultural technologies 
        will be needed to keep up with the growing demand. To accomplish this, 
        agricultural systems must increase production while at the same time more 
        effectively utilizing and conserving the resources that go into that 
        production. One possible solution is the collection and analysis of 
        environmental data. IoT sensor networks can cheaply provide distributed data 
        that can be used to improve plant health, increase harvest yields, and 
        decrease waste. The primary focus of this project will be to prototype a 
        distributed agricultural sensor network that will be able to monitor the 
        environment, network and analyze the data on the cloud, and finally provide 
        actuation to the environment.<p>
